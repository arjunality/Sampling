# Sampling
UCS654: Predictive Analytics using Statistics Assignment-3

In this assignment, I have used various different ML models (5) on the dataset to find out which Model and Sampling technique combination gives us the best accuracy.

The Models used-
1. Gaussian Naive Bayes'         (Model_1)
2. Support Vector Classifier     (Model_2)
3. Random Forest Classifier      (Model_3)
4. Decision Tree Classifier      (Model_4)
5. XGBoost Classifier            (Model_5)


The Sampling Techniques-
1. SMOTE                 (Sampling1)
2. Near Miss             (Sampling2)
3. TOMEK Links           (Sampling3)
4. Random Over Sampler   (Sampling4)
5. Random Under Sampler  (Sampling5)

RESULTS-
